# This is a Teamwork passion project and not officially supported by the team

The creators and maintainers of this project are doing it with enthusiasm and happiness, in odd moments between other projects and possibly even in their spare time. Please be kind to them, and understand that although they hope to get the time & energy to fix your bug :crossed_fingers:, this is not an officially supported product or service, and therefore doing so is not a part of their day jobs.

## Checklist

- [] changes include new automated tests covering them
- [] have tested manually yourself
- [] PR describes why you made the change, not just how
- [] PR describes where where we should look to best understand changes & their effects (in code, in the resulting running software, elsewhere?)
